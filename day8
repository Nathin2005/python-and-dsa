# OPERATIONS
# 1. CRUD OPERATION
# 2. STACK OPERATION
# 3. QUEUE OPERATION
# 4. DATA STRUCTURE TYPES

# 1. CRUD OPERATION
# CRUD OPERATION STANDS FOR CREATE, READ, UPDATE AND DELETE.
# 1. CREATE - IT IS USED TO CREATE A NEW RECORD IN THE DATABASE.
# 2. READ - IT IS USED TO READ THE RECORDS FROM THE DATABASE.
# 3. UPDATE - IT IS USED TO UPDATE THE RECORDS IN THE DATABASE.
# 4. DELETE - IT IS USED TO DELETE THE RECORDS FROM THE DATABASE.

# 2. STACK OPERATION
# STACK OPERATION IS A LIFO (LAST IN FIRST OUT) DATA STRUCTURE.
# 1. PUSH - IT IS USED TO ADD AN ELEMENT TO THE TOP OF THE STACK.
# 2. POP - IT IS USED TO REMOVE AN ELEMENT FROM THE TOP OF THE STACK.
# 3. PEEK - IT IS USED TO GET THE TOP ELEMENT OF THE STACK WITHOUT REMOVING IT.
# 4. IS EMPTY - IT IS USED TO CHECK WHETHER THE STACK IS EMPTY OR NOT.
# 5. SIZE - IT IS USED TO GET THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN THE STACK.

# 3. QUEUE OPERATION
# QUEUE OPERATION IS A FIFO (FIRST IN FIRST OUT) DATA STRUCTURE.
# 1. ENQUEUE - IT IS USED TO ADD AN ELEMENT TO THE END OF THE QUEUE.
# 2. DEQUEUE - IT IS USED TO REMOVE AN ELEMENT FROM THE FRONT OF THE QUEUE
# 3. PEEK - IT IS USED TO GET THE FRONT ELEMENT OF THE QUEUE WITHOUT REMOVING IT.
# 4. IS EMPTY - IT IS USED TO CHECK WHETHER THE QUEUE IS EMPTY OR NOT.
# 5. SIZE - IT IS USED TO GET THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN THE QUEUE.

# 1. PUSH

# 4. DATA STRUCTURE TYPES
# 1. LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE
# - THEY ARE IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER
# - THEY ARE NOT CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER
# 1. List
# 2. Tuple
# 3. set
# 2. NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE
# - THEY ARE NOT IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER
# - THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ELEMENTS
# - THEY ARE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER
# 1. Array
# 2. Linked List
# 3. Tree
# 4. Graph
# 3. HASH DATA STRUCTURE - KEY BASED DATA STRUCTURE
# 1. Dictionary
